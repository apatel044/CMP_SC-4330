#Checkerboard Retrospective

Most code going into initiating the object in Checkerboard.java was identical to the solution. However, My build method in the checkerboard file contained some repeated logic, having a more efficient methodology to creating the rectangles needed in build would have saved code. 
My main.java was very similar to the provided checkers.java. However, I used a startable which I know realize may not have been needed.
I used a vbox, may not have been needed. I also used separate methods for each size type instead of a smarter selectsize method as done in the key. Figuring this out however was relatively hard for me. The higher level logic was easy to understand and I think I have a good grip on the fundamentals and design patterns used here and covered in class, but the low and mid level logic/implementation proved to be more of a difficulty as I have limited experience with JavaFX outside this class.
Overall, I think my implementation was well done but not as optimally coded as the key, I could serve to learn to not reinvent the wheel and repeat code sections I donâ€™t need to. The program was however fully operational and received a good grade, meeting all the requirements set out with the challenge.
